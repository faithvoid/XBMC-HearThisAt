# HearThis.At for XBMC4Xbox
A HearThis.At Music plugin for the original Xbox using XBMC4Xbox.

## Features:
- Listen to the latest and most popular tracks of HearThis.At, or use the Explore page to find new sets, just like on the original website!
- (WIP) Livestream support! Listen to your favourite DJs perform live!
- Want to listen to a specific genre? There's a full genre list to choose from!
- (WIP) Search functionality to find that perfect set by that one artist!
- Works on the original Xbox, unlike the Kodi plugin! (which is also more advanced)

  To Do:
  - Fix Search functionality
  - Add Artists/Playlists/Sets/Songs/Genres/etc. to Search functionality
 
  ## Not Planned:
  - Account Integration (on a system as old as the Xbox, it sounds like a security nightmare. If someone wants to take on the work, feel free to send a pull request!)
