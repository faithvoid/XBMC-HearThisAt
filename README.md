## Features:
- Listen to the latest and most popular tracks of hearthis.at, or use the Explore page to find new sets, just like on the original website!
- (WIP) Livestream support! Listen to your favourite DJs perform live!
- Want to listen to a specific genre? There's a full genre list to choose from!
- Search functionality to find that perfect set by that one artist!
- Works on the original Xbox, unlike the Kodi plugin! (which, to be fair, is more advanced)

## Installation:
- Copy "plugin.music.hearthisatX" to "Q:/plugins/music" on your Xbox. 

## To Do:
- Add artist name beside track name
- Add Artists/Playlists/Sets/Songs/Genres/etc. to search functionality
- Bugfixes and optimizations.

## Bugs:
- Some searches just don't work and will present a rate-limiting error. This doesn't seem to be an addon issue, this seems to be an API backend issue with HearThis not liking certain terms (usually terms around 4 characters or less). Try a longer query and try the same query on PC to see if it also gives you an error.
- Artist search is currently broken.

 ## Not Planned:
- Account Integration(?) (on a system as old as the Xbox, it sounds like a security nightmare. If someone wants to take on the work, feel free to send a pull request!)
