## Features:
- Listen to the latest and most popular tracks of HearThis.At, or use the Explore page to find new sets, just like on the original website!
- (WIP) Livestream support! Listen to your favourite DJs perform live!
- Want to listen to a specific genre? There's a full genre list to choose from!
- Search functionality to find that perfect set by that one artist!
- Works on the original Xbox, unlike the Kodi plugin! (which is also more advanced)

## Installation:
- Copy "plugin.music.hearthisatX" to "Q:/plugins/music" on your Xbox. 

## To Do:
- Add Artists/Playlists/Sets/Songs/Genres/etc. to Search functionality
- Bugfixes and optimizations

 ## Not Planned:
- Account Integration (on a system as old as the Xbox, it sounds like a security nightmare. If someone wants to take on the work, feel free to send a pull request!)
